# Audacity Offline Setup Assistant

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Audacity Offline Setup Assistant**.

This tool provides a fully guided offline setup and configuration for the Audacity audio editor. It is designed for secure, air-gapped environments, corporate deployments, or any situation where an internet connection is not available or desired.

## Key Features

- **Fully Offline**: No internet connection required for installation or activation.
- **Complete Feature Set**: Unlocks all professional editing tools, export options, and plugin support.
- **Secure and Private**: No login, registration, or cloud sync needed. Your data stays on your machine.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started

To begin, please follow the [Installation Guide](installation.md) to set up Audacity on your system.

## How It Works

The assistant configures Audacity to run locally, ensuring all features are available without needing to contact external servers. This is ideal for:
- Classrooms and computer labs
- Enterprise and government environments
- Offline audio production workstations
- Users concerned with privacy

## Support

If you encounter any issues, please check the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) page or file a [bug report](https://github.com/AudacityAudio/audacity/issues/new/choose).
